            <p>I’m a frontend developer with over 5 years of experience building accessible, responsive, and secure web interfaces. My focus lies in crafting clean, maintainable code while collaborating across teams to create intuitive digital experiences.</p>

            <p>My main stack includes React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, with experience in both frontend-heavy and fullstack roles. I’ve worked on e-wallet platforms, data dashboards, component libraries, and internal tools — always with a mobile-first mindset and strong attention to performance and usability.</p>

            <p>I’m self-taught, proactive, and always exploring ways to improve developer experience, product quality, and accessibility. Whether it’s coding, debugging, or refactoring, I enjoy being hands-on and working closely with designers, backend engineers, and QA to bring reliable products to life.</p>

            <p>Outside of work, I practice Shotokan Karate (2nd Dan black belt), dive into tech learning, and enjoy games with exploration and storytelling. I believe good code and good martial arts share something in common: clarity, discipline, and constant refinement.</p>
