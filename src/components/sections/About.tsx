        <p>
          I’m a <span className="text-gray-300 font-semibold">Frontend Developer</span> with over <span className="text-gray-300 font-semibold">5 years of experience</span> building accessible, responsive, and secure web interfaces. My focus lies in crafting clean, maintainable code while collaborating across teams to create intuitive digital experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          My main stack includes <span className="text-gray-300 font-semibold">React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS</span>, with experience in both frontend-heavy and fullstack roles. I’ve worked on <span className="text-gray-300 font-semibold">e-wallet platforms</span>, data dashboards, component libraries, and internal tools — always with a <span className="text-gray-300 font-semibold">mobile-first mindset</span> and strong attention to performance and usability.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m <span className="text-gray-300 font-semibold">self-taught</span>, <span className="text-gray-300 font-semibold">proactive</span>, and always exploring ways to improve developer experience, product quality, and accessibility. Whether it’s coding, debugging, or refactoring, I enjoy being <span className="text-gray-300 font-semibold">hands-on</span> and working closely with designers, backend engineers, and QA to bring reliable products to life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of work, I practice <span className="text-gray-300 font-semibold">Shotokan Karate (2nd Dan black belt)</span>, dive into tech learning, and enjoy games with sandbox exploration and fantasy. I believe good code and martial arts share something in common: <span className="text-gray-300 font-semibold">clarity, discipline, and constant refinement</span>.
